rtl-sdr
turns your Realtek RTL2832 based DVB dongle into a SDR receiver
======================================================================

This is a modified version of the library found at https://github.com/steve-m/librtlsdr
that works with Android OTG devices by using the modified rtlsdr_open method.
You just have to supply an USB file descriptor retrieved from the USBDeviceConnection.
